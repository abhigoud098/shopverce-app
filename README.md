Shopverce — E-commerce Frontend (Polished README)

Shopverce is a modern, responsive e-commerce frontend where users can browse products, add them to cart, check discounts and stock availability, manage a wishlist, and complete a simulated checkout — all built without a backend (uses localStorage for persistence). This README explains what Shopverce does, how it’s organized, and what’s next.
